Personal- My current strategy for backing up my data is making a copy and storing it on an external hard drive.

School- My current strategy for backing up my data is utilizing OneDrive cloud services. Storing my data on the cloud allows me to access it on any device when in need.

One major weakness in my strategy for backing up my personal data is that it is centralized onto a singular drive. If my hard drive ever fails all of my data would be lost. I could upload my data unto a cloud service to have an extra method of retrieving my data.

To design a sound backup strategy plan, you should implement the 3-2-1 rule. The 3-2-1 rule states you should have three copies of your data stored on two different medias and one copy off site. For my plan I am going to make three copies of my files and store them on OneDrive, my external hard drive and an internal hard drive. When using OneDrive, I should set the frequency of my backups to every 2 days. Luckily, for my personal data I intend to only back up a handful of files as for system settings and software can be reinstalled whenever.
